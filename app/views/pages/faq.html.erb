<p class="faq_question"> What will the online classes cover? </p>
<p class="faq_answer"> There is no set curriculum - the classes are designed to help you progress at your preferred pace.
	<br> <br>
For most students, the first 8-10 weeks are dedicated to completing the contents of this online course to build a strong understanding of the Python basics. <br> <br>
Afterwards, your tutor will help you select and complete actual Python projects that you’ll find useful and interesting to build. </p>

<p class="faq_question"> How much does it cost? </p>
<p class="faq_answer"> We charge £12.95 per week, billed monthly. <br> <br>
This includes one weekly online class and the option of contacting your tutor with questions if you need more support during the week (we aim to respond within 24 hours). <br> <br>
You are free to cancel your subscription any time without any charges. </p>

<p class="faq_question"> I can’t attend class this week, what do I do? </p>
<p class="faq_answer"> Not a problem! Just let your tutor know and you won’t be charged for the week. </p>

<p class="faq_question"> How big are the online classes? </p>
<p class="faq_answer"> Each session has one teacher and a maximum of four students.  </p>

<p class="faq_question"> What will I be able to do by the end of the Codegates programme? </p>
<p class="faq_answer"> The Codegates programme is here to help you become a confident user of Python. <br> As a minimum, you will be able to:
	<br> <br>
- Demonstrate an understanding of essential coding concepts <br> 
- Apply those concepts to building basic Python programmes <br>
- Navigate available online Python resources <br> <br>
We will also set you up with your own GitHub account to display your completed projects - a valuable addition to any CV! </p>

<p class="faq_question"> I know coding is important, but why should I learn Python? </p>
<p class="faq_answer"> One reason is that Python is relatively easy to get started with, which is important for motivational reasons.
	<br> <br> But maybe even more importantly, Python is used in a very wide variety of different fields - data analysis, web-scraping, hobby robotics, machine-learning - you name it! <br> <br> Meaning that, whatever you end up doing eventually, it's very unlikely that you'll regret having started with Python.

<p class="faq_question"> I already know how to code, is this course for me? </p>
<p class="faq_answer"> This course is optimised for those with little to no experience in coding. If you already know Python or another language, you may find a course for intermediate or advanced programmers more beneficial. </p>

<p class="faq_question"> What if I still have questions? </p>
<p class="faq_answer"> Don’t hesitate to
