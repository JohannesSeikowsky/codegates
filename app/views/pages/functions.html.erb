	So far you've seen different types of functions that come with the Python language itself. Examples include built-in functions like len() or print() or functions that can be used on strings, lists or dictionaries like let's say [1, 2, 3, 4].remove(1) for instance.
	However on top of providing you with such functionalities directly Python (and all of the other widely used programming languages) also provides you with the ability to define your own functions and then, once you've defined them, use them in different places throughout the codebase you're writing. This is the topic that YK will explain in the tutorial below. 
	<br> <br>
	I would like to add that this topic of defining and using your own functions is one that pretty much everyone needs
	to engage with at least a few times before it really clicks and sinks in. I would therefore recommend you start by aiming to get a rough idea by watching the tutorial below and then afterwards gradually try to use the technique in the Mini-projects that are to follow. Following this there is no dedicated practice exercise for this topic, as in my opinion the only way to really understand this idea of defining your own functions is to see and do it in the context of "real" projects. A series of such "real" projects is the next section of this course.

	As usual I'd like to point out that YK is not directly affiliated with Codegates, but a very good teacher whom you should follow on Youtube if you want to. Enjoy!
