      Online Evening Classes
    </p>

    <p style="">
      We do online evening classes every day of the week except on Saturdays. The classes start daily at
      18.00, 19.00 and 20.00 respectively (UK-time) and last one hour each.

      <br> <br>
      Each class has up to 6 students and 1 coding tutor. 
      <br> <br>
      As a rule, most students attend one class per week on a relatively continuous basis.
      <br> <br>
      <!-- In general our goal is to teach people enough Python so they can use coding for their own purposes. To that end -->
      We firstly cover the
      basics of Python (8-10 classes) and then move each student on to a real coding project he/she actually wants to code.
      <br> <br>
      We charge Â£12.95 per class/week and you are free to cancel anytime.
      <br> <br>
      If you have any questions, you can use the "ask-a-tutor" button in the top-right corner. 
      If you'd like to join a class to see whether it's for you, you can easily do so below. Everybody is welcome!
