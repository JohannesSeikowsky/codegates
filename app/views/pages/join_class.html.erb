      Basics
    </p>

    <p style="">
      We do two online evening classes every day of the week, Monday-Friday. One from 18.00-19.00 and
      another from 19.00-20.00 (UK-time). Each class has up to 6 students and 1 coding tutor. 
      <br> <br>
      As a rule, most of our students attend one class per week on a relatively continuous basis.
      <br> <br>
      <!-- In general our goal is to teach people enough Python so they can use coding for their own purposes. To that end -->
      In general we firstly cover the
      basics of Python (8-10 classes) and then move each student on to a real coding project he/she actually wants to code.
      <br> <br>
      We charge Â£12.95 per class/week, you are free to cancel at your convenience and you can join your first class as a free trial.
      <br> <br>
