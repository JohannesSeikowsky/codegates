<p>
	"Classrooms" are a feature of Repl.it that allows us to work on practice tasks. <br> <br>
	- <%= link_to "Click here to gain access to our classroom", "https://repl.it/classroom/invite/1ituUa1", target: "_blank" %> 
	<br> <br>
	- Click "Codegates Python" (bottom left) to get to our classroom  <br> <br>
	- You can then see the different "Assignments" <br> <br>
	- Click on the Assignment named "Practice - Built-in Functions" <br> <br>
	- Within each assignment all practice instructions are on the right hand side. You can write and run your code on the left.  <br> <br>
	- Once you're reasonably satisfied hit the "submit" button (top right) and your tutor will be able to review your code.

	 and you can write your "answer code" on the left. You can run the code you write whenever and how often you like and submit it when you're satisfied with your "answer". The submission will then automaticaly be forwarded to your tutor.
	<br> <br>
	- As said, for the first assignment we're practicing Built-in Functions and the instructions can be found on the right hand side within the assignment. Have a go and submit your code when ready. Happy coding! <br> <br>
	NOTE: Don't feel like all your submissions need to be 100% correct and proper. You're not being graded, this is purely for practice, which is often messy, and our tutors are here to help, not judge.
