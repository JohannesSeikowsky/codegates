		Getting Started - All you need to know
	</span>

	<p> 
		This course is designed to teach you those parts of the Python programming language that are strictly necessary for you to start work on a project of your own. That is our goal here. We are not aiming to teach you everything there is to know about Python. Instead we believe that in programming you learn the most by actually working on actual projects that interest you. This means that our first task is to focus on mastering those parts of Python that are necessary to do so - the minimum to be dangerous so to speak. Of course you'll learn a lot more afterwards as well (learning is a continuous part of programming), but first things first. 
		<br> <br>
		<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Repl.it </span> <br>
		In the first "lesson" we will look at Repl.it, which will be our place for writing and playing with code. We're using Repl.it for this rather than one of the numerous alternatives, because it's insanely easy to get started with and will eventually allow your tutor to easily work with you on the same piece of code (like two people writing in the same Google-Doc). 
		<br> <br>
		<span style="text-decoration: underline;">  Tutorials and Exercises </span> <br>
		Then we'll dive into Python itself. Each "lesson" deals with one practically important topic in a relatively concise manner (the vast majority of video tutorials being 8-12 minutes long). Each lesson is then followed by a small set of practice exercises, which are not conceived to be brain-wrackingly hard, but rather to be an easy opportunity for you to reiterate the concept that you've just been introduced to. Repl.it will moreover allow you to submit your exercise code directly to your tutor, who will then be able to send you feedback. Similarly there's a large "Ask your tutor" field on the page of each lesson, which you can always use to easily ask a question.
		<br> <br>
		<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Co-coding Evenings </span> <br>
		Co-coding evenings are online classes that you can join at a time that suits you in order to work on this course or on your project. They take place every Monday, Wednesday and Friday between 19.00-21.30 UK-time. 
		<br> <br>
		During Co-coding evenings you mostly work by yourself whilst at least one tutor is present. That tutor "goes around" and drops in periodically on each student to see whether you need help with something. 
		Each student is free to join one co-coding evening per week and usually students choose one specific day as their default (e.g. every Thursday). Should your default day not work in any particular week you can easily adjust and attend another evening that week. Obviously you are not strictly obligated to attend one co-coding evening every week, but in general we more or less expect it of most of our students during most weeks. Your tutor will also be on hand to lightly nudge you towards this "one-a-week policy".

		<!--
		In our experience a good "policy" is to aim at joining one co-coding evening a week to make sure you keep progressing and maintain momentum and motivation.

		<br> <br>
		<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Personal Projects </span> <br>
		Once you're done with the basics, which will take roughly 8-12 hours of concentrated work overall, your tutor will help you get started with your first real coding project. This might start with a conversation about what you may be interested in creating or whether there maybe something in your day-to-day work that Python could help with. This will help to make sure you choose a starting point for your project that is realistic, relevant and interesting.
		<br> <br>
		Your tutor will then be your guide throughout that project, getting you set up, providing direction, guidance and selective technical support. While working on a project we strongly recommend sticking with the same "policy" of attending one co-coding evening during most weeks to keep building your coding knowledge and confidence. But for now it's time to check out Repl.it and get going with some Python :)
		<br> <br>
		Happy Coding!
