	<p>
		Congratulations for coming this far!
		<br> <br>
		If all went well, you should by now have a baseline level of familiarity with Python's facilities
		and how to use these in the composition of useful programmes.
		<br> <br>
		Now comes the real work of programming. Rather than just implementing a programme that has been set for you, 
		it's time to come up with something you actually want to code and have a go at building it.
		<br> <br>
		As figuring out a good starting point for such a project can be rather tricky (especially if one isn't acquainted with all the options),
		your tutor will help you figure out where to begin in the next class you attend.
		<br> <br>
		In the meantime feel free to liberally brainstorm things that you may want to code, so that you have something to discuss with your tutor.
		<br> <br>
		Happy Coding!
