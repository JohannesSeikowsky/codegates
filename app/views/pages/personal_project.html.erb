	<p>
		Congratulations for coming this far!
		<br> <br>
		If all went well, you should by now have a baseline level of familiarity with Python's facilities
		and how to use these in the composition of useful programs.
		<br> <br>
		Now comes the real work of programming. Rather than just implementing programs that have been set for you, 
		it's time to come up with something you actually want to code and have a go at building it.
		<br> <br>
		As figuring out a good starting point for such a project can be tricky (especially if one isn't acquainted with all the available options),
		your tutor will help you figure out where to begin in the next class.
		<br> <br>
		In the meantime feel free to liberally brainstorm things that you may want to code, so that you have something to discuss with your tutor.
		<br> <br>
		Happy Coding!
