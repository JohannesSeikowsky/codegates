		Congratulations! We assume that if you're here you've covered the basics of Python and worked on
		enough practice projects to feel reasonably comfortable with the process of working on code.
		<br> <br>

		<!--
		If all went well, you should by now have a baseline level of familiarity with Python's facilities
		and how to use these in the composition of useful programs.
		-->
		Now comes the real work of programming - building something you actually want to build.
		<br> <br>

		<!--
		 Rather than just implementing programs that have been preconceived for you, 
		it's time to come up with something you actually want to code and have a go at it.
		-->

		If you're atttending online classes, we suggest you brainstorm different things
		that interest you and try to come up with something. You can then use the next class to discuss
		different thoughts and ideas with your tutor and figure out a good starting point for the project together.
		<br> <br>
		In case you already have an idea and wonder whether it's something you can start to work on, 
		feel free to submit a description of it using our 
        <%= link_to "questions form", ask_tutor_path %>. 
        Simply start your submission with
		"Idea", we'll receive your project description and consider it's practicality.
		<br> <br>
		In case you aren't attending classes yet, you can join one
        <%= link_to "here", "https://calendly.com/coding_classes/times", target: "_blank" %>.
		<br> <br>
		
		<!--
		Have a conversation with your tutor about what project to pick and how to get started and then get to work.
