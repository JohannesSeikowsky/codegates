	<p>
		1. Choose an existing library that you're interested in like csv, random, datetime or requests for instance,
		and write code "on top of it". Meaning to write a few functions which underneath the hood map to the functions originally provided
		by the library. Your goal in this is to design the functions you write "on top" of the existing library so that
		they may be good for other programmers (and/or yourself) to use in coding. In short, write a tiny library on top of an existing library.
		<br> <br>
		<strong> Tip: </strong> Good question to ask: What did you yourself find tedious/annoying/hard-to-understand in the orginial
		library? Then design that insight into your own library.
