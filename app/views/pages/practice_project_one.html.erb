	<p>
		Before getting started on your own project, we're going to write 2 practice projects. This is important to cultivate the habit of applying the Python concepts we've learned to real-world tasks and problems, which is really what programming is all about.
		<br> <br>

		<!-- Below is a description of first project and below that a brief "start guide". -->
		
		<strong> Project </strong> <br> <br> 
		1. Write a programme within which you set the names and birthdays of five of your friends and which then checks whether today is actually the birthday of any of them.
		<br> <br>

		2. Extend the programme to send yourself an Email reminder if it is the case.
		<br> <br>

		
		<strong> Start Guide </strong> <br> <br>
		1. In your Repl.it account create a new Python environment and give it a name appropriate for the project.
		<br> <br>
		2. Consider in relatively general terms what the programme will need to do on a structural level.
		<br> <br>
		3. Consider how you may represent the different structural parts of the programme using the Python concept you've learned.
		<br> <br>
		4. Have a genuine go and fail :)
		<br> <br>
		5. Attend class and talk to your tutor, who will help you out. 
		<br> <br>
		<strong> Tip: </strong> Using Google and other external resources is not just ok, but encouraged! In the real world looking things up is not cheating.

		<!--
		<br> <br>
		Tip: When it comes to the problem of getting todays date at the time the program is executed. You may want to use a little
		known website called google.com to search for "How to get todays date Python"
