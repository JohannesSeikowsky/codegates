	<p>
		<strong> Project </strong>
		<br> <br>
		1. In a new Repl, write a program that generates a password composed of 15 randomly chosen characters each time it is run.
		<br> <br>
		2. Extend the program to save the generated password in an external text file named passwords.txt (which you'll have to create).

		<strong> General Advice </strong> 
		<br> <br>
		The first step in pretty much any coding project is to try to understand what you're trying to do
		on a general, structural level - What is the code supposed to do? What functionalities are required to make it happen? 
		<br> <br>
		Once you have a still rough, but somewhat formed idea, the next step is to try to figure out
		how to represent the functionalities needed in Python (or another language you may be using). 
		<br> <br>
		Thinking, googling and trial and error are the main
		ingredients to this process. In many ways coding something is a process of sassing things out, tinkering
		and adjusting as you go along.
